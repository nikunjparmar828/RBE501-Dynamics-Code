# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  develop  an  algorithm  to  numerically  calculate  the  mass  matrix  of  any  robotic 
manipulator.  Knowledge  of  the  mass  matrix  is  useful  to  implement  forward  dynamics  algorithms,  e.g.,  for  the 
purpose of simulating a robot; or to implement model-based control schemes.
